# Dockerized Pilbox

[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/lovelysystems/docker-pilbox.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/lovelysystems/docker-pilbox/tags/)


This project provides a docker image for the awesome Pilbox image proxy. Which we use
in production to convert images on the fly. From the [Plibox project page](http://agschwender.github.io/pilbox/):
> Pilbox is an image processing application server built on Pythonâ€™s Tornado web framework using the Python Imaging Library (Pillow). It is not intended to be the primary source of images, but instead acts as a proxy which requests images and resizes them as desired.

## Run as Service

The example below is a typical image proxy service definition in a
`docker-compose.yml` file for deployment under [Docker-Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/)
 or just locally with [docker-dompose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```yaml
  imageproxy:
    image: lovelysystems/docker-pilbox:1.3.300
    command:
      - "--client_key=somesharedsecret"
      - "--implicit_base_url=https://www.lovelysystems.com/"
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"
```

## Run as Container

To run just start the container with optional arguments like this:

```
docker run --rm lovelysystems/docker-pilbox:dev
```


## Developer Notes

### Build and Release

Take a look at the [Lovely Gradle Plugin project page](https://github.com/lovelysystems/lovely-gradle-plugin) on how to build
and deploy the docker image.
